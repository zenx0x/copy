I apologize for the confusion. It seems the fcitx5-module-kimpanel package is not available in the Arch Linux official repositories. You can install the fcitx5-kimpanel-git package from the AUR (Arch User Repository) instead.

To install fcitx5-kimpanel-git, you can use an AUR helper like yay. If you haven't installed yay yet, you can do so with the following commands:

bash
Copy code
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel git
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
makepkg -si
After installing yay, you can install fcitx5-kimpanel-git using the following command:

bash
Copy code
yay -S fcitx5-kimpanel-git
Once the installation is complete, restart fcitx5:

bash
Copy code
killall fcitx5
fcitx5 &
Now, follow the previous instructions to add the kimpanel applet/widget to your panel, and check if it works correctly with fcitx5.
